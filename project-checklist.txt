Getting started:
[ ] Complete a mockup
[ ] Set up project folder
[ ] Hook up Knockout and organize js into MVVM files
[ ]	Acquire API keys and understand documentation

Interface Requirements:
[ ] All application components render on-screen in a responsive manner
[ ] All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

App Functionality:
[ ] Includes a text input field or dropdown menu that filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input or selection. Filter function runs error-free.

[ ] A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied.

[ ] Clicking a location on the list displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker (e.g. bouncing, color change.)

[ ]List functionality is responsive and runs error free.

[ ] Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.

[ ] Clicking a marker displays unique information about a location in either an infoWindow or DOM element.

[ ] Markers should animate when clicked (e.g. bouncing, color change.)

[ ] Any additional custom functionality provided in the app functions error-free.

App Architecture:
[ ] Code is properly separated based upon Knockout best practices (follow an MVVM pattern, avoid updating the DOM manually with jQuery or JS, use observables rather than forcing refreshes manually, etc). Knockout should not be used to handle the Google Map API.

[ ] There are at least 5 locations in the model. These may be hard-coded or retrieved from a data API.

Asynchronous Data Usage:
[ ] Application utilizes the Google Maps API and at least one non-Google third-party API.

[ ] All data requests are retrieved in an asynchronous manner.

[ ] Data requests that fail are handled gracefully using common fallback techniques (i.e. AJAX error or fail methods). 'Gracefully' means the user isn’t left wondering why a component isn’t working. If an API doesn’t load there should be some visible indication on the page (an alert box is ok) that it didn’t load. Note: You do not need to handle cases where the user goes offline.

Location Details Functionality:
[ ] Functionality providing additional data about a location is provided and sourced from a 3rd party API. Information can be provided either in the marker’s infoWindow, or in an HTML element in the DOM (a sidebar, the list view, etc.)

[ ] Provide attribution for the source of additional data. For example, if using Foursquare, indicate somewhere in your UI and in your README that you are using Foursquare data.

[ ] Functionality is presented in a usable and responsive manner

Documentation:
[ ] A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

[ ] Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.

[ ] Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.

[ ] If build tools (such as Gulp or Grunt) are used, both source and production code are submitted in the same repository in separate directories. These directories are usually named src and dist respectively.

Suggestions:
[ ] Add unique functionality beyond the minimum requirements (i.e. the ability to “favorite” a location, etc.).

[ ] Incorporate a build process allowing for production quality, minified code, to be delivered to the client.

[ ] Data persists when the app is closed and reopened, either through localStorage or an external database (e.g. Firebase).

[ ] Include additional third-party data sources beyond the minimum required.

[ ] Style different markers in different (and functionally-useful) ways, depending on the data set.

[ ] Implement additional optimizations that improve the performance and user experience of the filter functionality (keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete functionality, filtering of multiple fields, etc).

[ ] Integrate all application components into a cohesive and enjoyable user experience.
